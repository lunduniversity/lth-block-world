# lth-block-world
A modell of LTH in a minecraft-compatible world file.

For now, this repository contains two Minecraft worlds; LTH-E-huset was created withMinecraft version 1.16.2, the other one is the original world from 2013, resaved in Minecraft 1.11.2 for use with MineRL:

*LTH-E-huset*: To use it, simply download it (and if necessary after a download as .zip-file, unpack the file) and plug it into a Minecraft client as described below.   
  
As you will see, a Minecraft world description is made up of a complete directory containing a lot of configuration information, but the really crucial parts are the file *level.dat* and the subdirectory *region*.   
  
Obviously, to make use of the world just as is, you need a Minecraft installation on a suitable machine; this you can learn about and obtain on the [Minecraft homepage](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/).  
  
Once you have Minecraft installed, move or copy the entire directory *LTH-E-huset* into the folder called *saves* within your Minecraft data directory; hints on where and how to find this per operating system can be found [here](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360035131551-Where-are-Minecraft-files-stored-).  
  
Now start your Minecraft client, press **Play** and choose *Single Player Mode*, then choose LTH-E-huset from the list of possible worlds (usually empty at first start). 
  
Enjoy finding your way in (a not entirely perfect virtual version of) E-huset!  

*LTH-E-huset-11.2*: Handle with care - do NOT load it into a new version of Minecraft to have it viable for MineRL. Contains more flaws wrt the actual building, but might work...
